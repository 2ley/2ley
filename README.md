## Eric Tooley (@2ley), Senior PMM

I joined GitHub's [Product Marketing Team](https://github.com/github/product-marketing/blob/main/README.md) in August, 2022 to focus on supply chain security 🔐

## Top ZOGs (Zones of Genius) 🧠
* Cheeky product, feature, and drag character names, including the (tragically imaginary) vocal duo, _Enya Boca and Sia Fellas_ 👯‍♂️
* Clearing brain fog with questions like, “For this to make sense, what else must be true?” and “What would change if, rather than the _best_ one, we tried to make a _better one_?” 🤯
* Punchy headlines and merciless copy editing 🤺
* Video conferencing gear for remote work 🤓

## The More You Know... 🌈
My 🇨🇳 husband speaks English with grammatical precision to which native speakers can scarcely aspire. As for my Chinese, I can count, name a few foods, and announce bathroom intentions with needless specificity 🫣, proof that my inner child remains in the 4th grade.🤦‍ We live in Campbell, CA, sing in the Silicon Valley Gay Men’s Chorus 👯‍♂️, and swim competitively with SF Tsunami. 🧜‍♂️🥇🦈

## Prime Directive 🖖
 I budget 10% of my time to be of service to others. Let’s make a win-win together!
